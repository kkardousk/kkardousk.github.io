Hello! I'm a data scientist/enthusiast with a passion for analyzing and visualizing information to uncover meaningful insights. My background spans across data science, statistics, and research methodologies.

On this website, I share various data projects I've worked on, focusing particularly on:

- Data replications of interesting studies and articles
- Visualizations that help tell stories through data
- Analysis of topics related to economics, healthcare, and social sciences

### My Approach

I believe in transparent, reproducible data analysis. When working on projects, I strive to:

- Clearly document my methodology and thought process
- Share code and data sources when possible
- Present findings in accessible, visually appealing formats
- Acknowledge limitations and potential biases in my analysis
